## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. I imported pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to conduct this analysis. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This analysis serves to satify a course requirement for the Udacity Data Scientist nanodegree program. For this project, I was most interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What are the differences in salary and satisfaction between developers with interdisciplinary academic backgrounds?
2. What are the differences in salary and satisfaction between developers at different education levels?
3. What are the differences in salary and satisfaction between developers that say they don't understand computers well?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In addition to this README file, I have one notebook that contains all of the steps I took to analyze the dataset. I use markdown notes as a guide through each step following the CRISP-DM process. The resulting data visuals are saved as png files for easy upload to the blog post found on Medium at the link below.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@m.knox0826/can-i-be-successful-as-a-developer-even-if-5883f7b92eb3).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
